Bugs:

-enqueue() function add to the front of queue or peekfront() only peeks m_back pointer

-peekfront() function peeks the back of queue due to enqueue() add iteams to the front or its only peek m_back pointer

-dequeue() function remove the back of queue or only due to enqueue() add iteams at the front (and its work fine)

-~Queue() function does not destroy all the iteams after exiting the program (Memory leaks)
